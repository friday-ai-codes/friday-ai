<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-next` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<arguments>{{GSD_ARGS}}</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
GSD smart entry — the state-aware front door. Detect what's going on in this project, then present a short menu of the right next actions and dispatch to one.

This is a launcher/router only. It never does the work itself. It reads project + workflow state via `gsd-tools smart-entry --json`, shows a situation-appropriate menu, and hands off to an existing GSD command.

<process>
Follow .cursor/gsd-core/workflows/smart-entry.md. Detect the situation, present the menu, and dispatch exactly one command. Then stop.
